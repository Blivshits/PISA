# PISA Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data contains results of PISA 2012 assesments or students of 65 economies in math, reading and science.There are 485,490 records and 636 columns (i.e. different variables/characteristics of data).
There are a lot of materials related to this dataset and results of assesment on OECD website - https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/pisa-2012-assessment-and-analytical-framework_9789264190511-en

Dataset contains full list of answers, estimates and results of assesment. A lot of questions are in form of categorital data (i.e. "Agree"/"Disagree" and so on).

However, the suggested data dictionary doesn't provide sufficient description of dataset variables. More detailed description of questions and possible answers is here - https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/pisa-2012-assessment-and-analytical-framework/background-questionnaires_9789264190511-9-en and here https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/PISA-2012-technical-report-final.pdf



## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I focus my attention on three test results (in math, in reading and in science) and a 4 variables, that can be a predictors/explainers of results.
However, most important findings is that good predictor of lower results (on average) is age of first access to internet. If student didn't access up to 12, his or her result probable will be lower.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on my key findings. I start by introducing my choice of variables and then describe test results variables, 
then we look at the correlation of variables and discuss one unexpected result that result in test don'r correlate to lessons duration.
After I show how quatity of books at home and test result in reading are connected with each other and how math lessons duration help to be more aware in knowing some math (however, let's say it again - it doesn't help with test). 

Finally, we checked how math age of access to Internet and math knowledge is important to test result. Here we find most interesing point (as I say earlier) - age of 13 is good threshold indicator of good test results.
